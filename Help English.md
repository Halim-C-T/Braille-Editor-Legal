# Braille Editor Help
With the Braille Editor application, you can translate a plain text document written in standard Turkish or English to computer Braille format so that Braille printers and Braille displays can recognize it correctly.
You can also view visual representations of Braille dots on the screen. The application can translate Braille without contraction for Turkish and English, but the automatic language detection feature is not supported.

You can set the rotor to titles to easily navigate the following topics with VoiceOver. You may need to use the VO down arrow command to access the alerts in the application with VoiceOver.

## General Information
Braille Editor is a document-based application. When you first open the application, a standard file opening screen appears. From here, you can create a new document or open an existing document.

Braille Editor supports UTF8-encoded ".txt", ".brf", ".brl" files, as well as some plain text formats provided they are UTF8 encoded. The application works the same way for all file extensions, but Braille screens can behave differently according to the file extension.

You can select the file type on the file save screen. When you select the "Braille text document" option, your file is saved with the .brf extension. The application always saves new documents with UTF8 encoding.
In-App Purchase and Subscription Information
Braille Editor is a subscription-based application. There are two auto-renewable subscriptions, monthly and yearly. These subscriptions offer a one week free trial. To avoid being charged after the free trial, you must cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the renewal date. If you cancel the subscription, you can access the application until the end of the period.
There is another in-app purchase product in the app that provides unlimited usage with a one-time fee. Since this option does not support the free trial model, you must first start the trial by selecting one of the subscriptions, cancel the subscription before the trial period expires, and continue after the time expires by selecting the appropriate option for you.
The screen required to perform these operations appears when you open a new or existing document. In addition, informative and guiding screens appear instead of the editor, in case of accidental purchases or in cases where your payment method cannot be charged for subscriptions.
In the relevant section in the Settings section, you can see when and at what price your subscription will be renewed or when it will expire if you have canceled it. If you have paid for unlimited use, you can see the information on this page.
In-app purchase features require an internet connection and if you don't have an internet connection, you may not be able to use the app even if you paid for it.
## Editor Interface
The only functional area on the editor screen is the text field where you view and edit your document. The button called "Document operations" here is a standard button found in most document-based applications. Other options are available in the "Braille" menu, which can be accessed from the menu bar. These options are explained in the following topics.
## Standard Braille Translation
This is the first option in the Braille menu and gives access to the Braille translation, the most important function of the app.

When you select this option, tabs at the top and then a screen with descriptions and options open. The two buttons at the bottom allow you to cancel the process or continue the process.

The first option on this screen allows you to select the language taken into account during translation. This option does not change the interface language of the application. To change the interface language, you must go to the Braille Editor settings from the "Settings" application on your device.
After the language option, there is an option called "Visual Braille translation". If this option is turned on, the translated document will not be compatible with Braille displays and printers, and you can instead visually display your document with Braille dots on the device screen.

Additional translation-related settings appear after this option and its description. If you open these settings, you can adjust their details in other tabs.

Press the "Translate" button and the translation process will start and in most cases it will be completed within a few seconds.
If the process takes longer, a screen showing the progress will appear and you can cancel the process from this screen. This will not cause data loss in your document.
When the process is completed, as soon as you respond to the warning, your document will be updated with the translated version and you will return to the editor again.

In translated documents, some characters are replaced by different characters, but printers and Braille displays detect them correctly. You can switch to visual Braille format to check on the app that they look right.
